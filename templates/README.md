This is the code for the website http://benstechgarage.com. This code can be used and modified. It is open source, just tell me if you do anything with the code because I would love to see it. You might want to make a pull request again once in a while because I am constantly modifying this code. Eventually, this code will be converted to Python to be hosted on Heroku with Flask. That's down the road though. Thanks Rich @ras592 for your help with troubleshooting!
